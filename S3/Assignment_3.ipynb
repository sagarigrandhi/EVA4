not return modified data, but change values in the tensor. The in-place version of the operation has trailing underscore according to Pytorch's naming convension - in the exmaple above it is `clamp_`\n","*   tensors have the same indexing as Numpy's arrays - one can use `:` seperated range, negative indexes and so on.\n","\n","\n",".\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","# Images and their representations\n","\n","Now, let's discuss images, their representations and how different Python libraries work with them. \n","\n","Probably, the most well-known library for image loading and simple processing is [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). \n","\n","However, many people in deep learning area stick with OpenCV for image loading and processing with some usage of another libraries when it is justified by performance/functionality. This is because OpenCV is in general much faster than the other libraries. Here you can find a couple of benchmarks: \n","\n","*   https://www.kaggle.com/zfturbo/benchmark-2019-speed-of-image-reading\n","*   https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations#benchmarking-results\n","\n","To sum up the benchmarks above, there are two most common image formats, PNG and JPEGs. If your data is in PNG format - use OpenCV to read it. If it is in JPEG - use libturbojpeg. For image processing, use OpenCV if possible. _We will be using PIL a lot along with these._\n","\n","As you will read the code from others, you may find out that some of them use Pillow/something else to read data. You should know, that color image representations in OpenCV and other libraries are different - OpenCV uses \"BGR\" channel order, while others use \"RGB\" one. \n","\n","To change \"BRG\" <-> \"RGB\"

we have 2 in 2.0*(y_pred - y)? Ans: \n","* It does serve the purpose, but we can run the code without it as well, and the model will get trained, though mathematically we would not be accurate in calling it proper gradient. (without \"2\" convergence is slower, loss is still higher)\n","\n","* We are calculating the gradient of y which is derivate of (y_pred - y)^2.
