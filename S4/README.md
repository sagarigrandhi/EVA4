# Session 4 Assignment

* 99.4% validation accuracy
* Less than 20k parameters
* Less than 20 epochs
* No fully connected layer

##  Architectural Basics 
* Layers to add in a network 
* Receptive Field
* 3x3 Convolutions
* MaxPooling - position, distance from prediction
* No of channels
* Image Normalization
* 1x1 Convolutions - position
* Transition layers - position
* Softmax
* Batch Normalization - position, distance from prediction
* Dropout - position, distance from the prediction
* Larger kernel or alternatives - When to stop convolutions and go ahead
* Performance - How do we know network is not doing well, comparatively, very early
* Batch Size - effects of batch size
* Learning Rate
